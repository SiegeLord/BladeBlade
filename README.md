# Blade Blade

A game for TINS 2021, by SiegeLord.

## Summary

Kill monsters, get stronger, repeat. You win when you become godlike.

## Controls

- Mouse LMB: Move
- Mouse RMB: Dash (when available)
- Esc - Quit
- R - Restart

Also, you can edit `options.cfg` for some settings.

# Building instructions

1. Install Allegro 5.

2. Install Rust from rust-lang.org. You'll need the nightly version.

3. Run `cargo run --release` to build and run the game.

On Windows, you can use the pre-built binaries (extracted in the `allegro`
subdirectory). `run_msys.sh` may be useful for this purpose.

## Rules Explanations

*Humoristic/Funny. Make the player laugh out loud at least once by funny situations, dialogue, or anything else in your game.*

The reward giver cracks some bad jokes. Some enemies are ostensibly named in a funny fashion.

*Inspired by MC Escher*

The grid is a bunch fo tiles.

*The game should contain a plug for another program or thing you made.*

The reward giver plugs some of my older games.

*Hexagonal - something in the game must be hexagonal*

The grid is somewhat hexagonal sometimes. Also, the quest giver is enclosed in a hexagon.

*Bonus rule*

Unused, although I do actually have a unit tests.
